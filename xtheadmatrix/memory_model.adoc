=== Matrix Memory Model

Matrix memory instructions appear to execute in program order on the local hart.

Memory operations for each element are unordered within the instruction.

Matrix memory instructions follow RVWMO at the instruction level. Except for when a pair of read access the same locations, and at least one of the reads is generated by matrix instructions, they will not necessarily appear to execute in the same order by other processors.
