==== Matrix Multiplication Instructions

Matrix multiplication instructions take matrixA(sizeMxsizeK) and
matrixB(sizeNxsizeK) from matrix registers specified by ms1 and ms2, and
accumulate the multiplication result of A[M][K] * (B[N][K])T to
matrixC(sizeM x sizeN) from md register, the output will overwrite the
accumulation register.

* shape of matrixA: M rows(sizeM), K columns(sizeK/element size in byte)
* shape of matrixB: N rows(sizeN), K columns(sizeK/element size in byte)
* shape of matrixC: M rows(sizeM), N columns(sizeN)

The function description:

....
for(int i=0; i<sizeM; i++) {
  for(int j=0; j<sizeN; j++) {
      for(int k=0; k<(sizeK/element size); k++)
         C[i,j] += A[i,k]*B[j,k];
}}}
....

The ISA specification provides different instructions to support float
and integer matrix multiplication and and operation. Hardware design has
the flexibility of supported data types.

The float matrix multiplication reuses the floating-point control and
status register, fcsr, to select the dynamic rounding mode for
floating-point arithmetic operations and hold the accrued exception
flags.

image:FCSR.png[FCSR.png]

The float matrix multiplication uses the dynamic rounding mode in frm. If
frm is set to an invalid value (101-111), any subsequent attempt to
execute a floating-point operation with a dynamic rounding mode will cause
an illegal instruction exception.

[width="100%",cols="3,3,7",options="header",]
|===
|rounding mode |Mnemonic |Meaning
|000 |RNE |Round to Nearest, ties to Even
|001 |RTZ |Round towards Zero
|010 |RDN |Round Down (towards -∞)
|011 |RUP |Round Up (towards +∞)
|100 |RMM |Round to Nearest, ties to Max Magnitude
|101 | |Invalid. Reserved for future use
|110 | |Invalid. Reserved for future use
|111 | |Invalid in rounding mode register
|===

If the floating-point unit status field mstatus.FS is off then any
attempt to execute a matrix floating-point instruction will raise an
illegal instruction exception. Any matrix floating-point instruction
that modifies any floating-point extension state (i.e., floating-point
CSRs or f registers) must set mstatus.FS to Dirty. The basic operation
of float matrix multiplication is float dot , the float dot operations
follow the IEEE-754/2008 standard.

''''
_For float dot, if any operand element
is NaN or a product of ∞ x 0 or a sum of infinities of different signs,
the result is NaN. Except when otherwise stated, if the result is NaN,
it is the canonical NaN. A product of ∞ x 0 or a sum of infinities of
different signs signals the invalid operation exception. Otherwise, sums
are computed with no avoidable intermediate exception conditions in the
calculation and the final result is determined from that intermediate
result. If the final result overflows, signal overflows. If the final
result underflows, signal underflows. If the final result is
inexact, signal is inexact._

''''

The standard matrix floating-point instructions treat elements as
IEEE-754/2008-compatible values. If the EEW of a matrix floating-point
operand does not correspond to a supported IEEE floating-point type, the
instruction encoding is reserved. For bf16-extension, 16-bit
floating-point element can be seen as bf16 or fp16.

===== Float Matrix Multiplication (non-widening)

Non-widen float matrix multiplication
indicates the source and destination operands data width keep the same

The integer matrix multiplication with destination data width is four-times that  of the source data width. The source operand data width in instruction encoding supported are int8 and int16, other data widths are reserved. Both signed/unsigned versions are provided . Thus, the source operand can be both signed/both unsigned/signed-unsigned/unsigned-signed, the result of multiplication is sign-extended before addition  and accumulation. Overflow is ignored and the result wraps around.

==== Matrix Load/Store Instructions

Matrix load instructions load a matrix from memory to matrix register.
and matrix store instructions store a matrix from matrix register to
memory.

image:MLS.jpeg[matrix_load.jpg]

The element data width is in instruction encoding, including
byte/halfword/word/doubleword, other data widths are reserved. The base
address is in rs1 and row stride in byte is in rs2, md/ms3 is the
register index for destination of matrix load and source for matrix
store.

....

Matrix shape (MxK) is in matrix size configure register, M given by sizeM and K given by sizeK(in byte). M=sizeM <= RLEN/32, K=sizeK/element size in byte, sizeK <= RLEN/8. If sizeM < RLEN/32 or sizeK < RLEN/8,  the matrix register data  with row index > sizeM or column  index > (sizeK/ element size in byte) set zero  for load, and don't write to memory for store.

There are 2 versions provided: (1)normal (2) whole
register load/store.

Whole register load/store data with maximum matrix size from/to memory with sizeM = RLEN/32 and sizeK = RLEN/8. The matrix size configurations are ignored.

''''

_These instructions are intended to be used to save and restore matrix registers when the length of the current contents of the matrix register is not known, or where modifying matrix size would be costly. Examples include compiler register spills,  function calls where values are passed in matrix registers, interrupt handlers, and OS context switches. Software can determine the number of bytes transferred by reading the xmlenb register._

''''

rs2 field is reused to specify the register number. rs2[4:3] is set to 0,
otherwise reserved. rs2[2:0] is nf field, encoding how many matrix
registers to load and store using the NFIELDS encoding. md/ms2 register
index should be aligned with the register number.

All matrix load/store instructions may generate and accept a non-zero
row-start value. The row-start register is reset to zero at the end of
the matrix instruction execution.

With the ZIHINTNTL extension, matrix memory access instruction can behave as stream memory access operations to fit different memory hierarchy.
Stream memory access instructions have the same
function as normal matrix load/store instructions, except that the data
may not be reused in the near future which can be potentially optimized
by hardware implementation.

==== Configuration Instructions

Matrix configuration instructions configure a field or the whole matrix size configuration register. The field retains the value if not changed by a configuration instruction. The index field of the instruction indicates which field is updated,  sizeM/sizeK/sizeN or the entire configure register as following table shows. The new matrix size are returned to rd.

For matrix-matrix instructions, both sources are matrix. For matrix-vector instructions, src2 is matrix and src1 is one row of matrix.  Use row0 as an example, the vector operand operates on each row of matrix operand as md[i, j] = ms2[i, j] op ms1[0, j].

madd performs the addition of src1 and src2. msub performs the subtraction of src2 from src1. mmul performs the multiplication of src1 and src2. Overflows are ignored and the low XLEN bits of results are written to the destination rd.  The mmul versions write the low bits of the product to the destination
register, while the mmulh versions write the high bits of the product to the destination register. mmax and mmin perform signed and unsigned compares respectively.

Matrix shift instructions including th.mn4clip/th.msll/th.msrl/th.msra.

th.mn4clip/th.mn4clipu instructions are used to pack a fixed-point value into a 4x narrower destination. Rounding, scaling and saturation are supported. The scaling shift amount comes from a matrix (specified by ms1), a vector(ms1[uimm3]) . The low 6-bits for 64-bit and 5-bits for 32-bit source data width are used, the higher bits are ignored. Saturation sets xmsat if the destination overflows.

msll msrl and msra perform logical left logic right and arithmetic right shift, the source data is in ms2, and the shift amount is provided by a matrix/vector data specified by ms1/ms1[uimm3].

Matrix shift instructions support rounding with rounding mode specified in the xmxrm CSR. For clip instructions, rounding occurs before saturation.

Widen float pointwise instruction indicates destination operand data width is twice that of the source operand. The data width of source operand is in instruction encoding. If the source element is fp16/bf16 floating-point data, the destination element is fp32 floating-point data, the instruction is classified as fp16/bf16 pointwise arithmetic instructions. If the source element is fp32 floating-point data, the destination element is fp64 floating-point data, the instruction is classified as fp32 pointwise arithmetic instructions. As data width for destination matrix is twice that of source matrix, two matrix register(register-pair) are used by destination matrix specified by md and md+1. Instructions specifying an odd-numbered md is reserved.

===== Float integer Conversion Instructions

Float integer conversion instructions are optionally supported.

* for conversion between fp32 and int32,  legal if bit[29] and bit[4] of xmisa register are both set to 1, also legal if bit[29] and bit[7] of xmisa register are both set to 1, illegal In all other cases
* for conversion between fp16 and int8,  legal if bit[29] and bit[3] of xmisa register are all set to 1, also legal if bit[29] and bit[6] of xmisa register are all set to 1, illegal In all other cases

The conversion from integer to floating point supports non-widen conversion/double widen conversion. Integers support signed and unsigned integers. For double widen conversion, two matrix registers are used by destination matrix specified by md and md+1. Instructions specifying an odd-numbered md is reserved.

===== Mrelease Instruction
The th.mrelease Instruction sets MS to Initial state.

....
th.mrelease
....
_th.mrelease shares the encoding with mcfgi, with index filed is 3'b111._



=====  Matrix Move Instructions

Matrix move instructions ignore matrix size configuration.

====== move between matrix registers

The th.mmov.mm instruction moves a whole matrix register to another matrix register.

The th.mmov.mv.i instruction moves and duplicates a vector to every row of the destination matrix register. The vector data is a row of matrix register, indexed by uimm3.The log2 (RLEN/32) bits are used.

....
#matrix-matrix mov
th.mmov.mm md, ms1
#matrix-vector add,rs1'/uimm3
mmov.mv.i md, ms1[uimm3]
....

====== move from GPR to matrix registers

The th.mdup<b/h/w/d>.m.x instruction moves and duplicates a scalar data to every element of the destination matrix register.

The th.mmov<b/h/w/d>.m.x instruction moves a scalar data to an element of the destination matrix register. The elements number within a matrix row is selected by rs1, modulo the number of such elements in a row. The row number is selected by rs1 , divided by the number of such elements in a row. The low log~2~(xmlenb/ element size) bits are used.

The scalar data is taken from the scalar x register specified by rs2 with XLEN data width. If data width < XLEN, the least-significant bits are copied and the upper bits are ignored. If data width > XLEN, the value is sign-extended.

....
#matrix-scalar mov with duplicate
th.mdup<b/h/w/d>.m.x md, rs2
#matrix-scalar mov
th.mmov<b/h/w/d>.m.x md, rs2, rs1
....

====== move from matrix registers to GPR
th.mmov<b/h/w/d>.x.m instruction moves a scalar data from a matrix register to a general purpose register specified by rd.

The scalar data is indexed by rs1. The elements number within a matrix row is selected by rs1, modulo the number of such elements in a row. The row number is selected by rs1, divided by the number of such elements in a row.  The low log~2~(xmlenb/ element size) bits of rs1 are used.

If data width > XLEN, the least-significant XLEN bits are transferred and the upper bits are ignored. If data width < XLEN, the value is sign-extended to XLEN bits.
