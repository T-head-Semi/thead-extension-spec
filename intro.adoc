== Introduction

The T-Head extension collection was created to augment
the RISC-V ISA by adding additional functionality
to enable faster and more energy-efficient solutions.

The RISC-V ISA and its standardized extensions provide a rich set of
instructions suitable for a wide range of applications, starting from
specialized microcontrollers to HPC systems.
The suitability for such a range of systems comes from the fact that
the RISC-V ISA is modularized with a base instruction set and a range
of extensions that target specific target applications and functionality.

The RISC-V ISA and its authors strongly advertise the ability
to create vendor extensions. Dedicated encoding spaces ensure,
that there are not conflicts with standard extensions.

This document specifies the T-Head extension collection,
a collection of vendor extensions that are implemented
in many T-Head processors.

=== Overview

The T-Head extension collection follows the principles of the RISC-V ISA.
The collection consists of the following ISA extensions:

* `XTheadMxStatus` provides a CSR to probe the availability of XThead* extensions.
* `XTheadCmo` provides instructions for cache management.
* `XTheadSync` provides instructions for multi-processor synchronization.
* `XTheadBa` provides instructions for address calculations.
* `XTheadBb` provides instructions for basic bit-manipulation.
* `XTheadBs` provides single-bit instructions.
* `XTheadCondMov` provides instructions for conditional moves.
* `XTheadMemIdx` provides GPR memory operations.
* `XTheadMemPair` provides two-GP-register memory operations.
* `XTheadFMemIdx` provides floating-point memory operations.
* `XTheadMac` provides multiply-accumulate instructions.
* `XTheadFmv` provides double floating-point high-bit data transmission instructions.
* `XTheadInt` provides acceleration interruption instructions.
* `XTheadVdot` provides instructions for vector dot.
* `XTheadVector` provides instructions for thead vector.

=== Dependencies to standard extensions

The T-Head extension collection is designed to be compatible
with RISC-V's base integer instruction sets RV32I and RV64I.

Some instructions are only available if the system's
`XLEN` is 64 (i.e. integer registers and supported user
address space is 64 bits).
To highlight the availability, each extension documents
this for each instruction.

Instruction that operate on floating-point registers can
be used in combination with `F` (32-bit floating-point register)
or `D` (64-bit floating-point registers).
Some instruction are only available if the system implements
the `D` extension. To highlight the availability, each
floating-point extension document this for each instruction.

For probing of the extension's availability the extension
`Zicsr` is required to read out the `th.mxstatus` CSR.
Refer to <<#xtheadmxstatus>> for more information about the `th.mxstatus` CSR.

=== Lifecycle

The lifecycle of the extensions included in this document is
defined on a per-extension base.

Possible states are:

* `Draft`: No guarantees (everything may change).
* `Stable`: No feature additions/removals/changes. Only clarifications.

A `draft` specification is expected to become `stable` in the future
(with exepcted changes until then). A `stable` extension remains in that
state for ever.
